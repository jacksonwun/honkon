Cost of Living: The DWP financial support available to households in March
A number of schemes are in place to help people with the cost of living


The UK Government is set to deliver further financial support to people to help them during the cost of living crisis this month.

A number of schemes are currently in place while details are being finalised for cost of living payments which will be available to those on certain benefits this Spring.

However, some of the support available will be stopping at the end of this month, such as cold weather payments and the warm home discount.


These are the payments available to households this month;

Cold Weather Payment
With snow predicted in some areas of the UK across March, you could still receive payments for "freezing" weather.

Until March 31, you could receive £25 for each seven-day period when temperatures drop below zero degrees in your area.

The payment should be made automatically within 14 working days, and you can receive multiple Cold Weather Payments if there are several spells of freezing weather.

So if this March is a frosty one - you could get paid twice.

To get the Cold Weather Payment, you must be claiming at least one of six particular benefits, these include:

Pension Credit
Income Support
Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
Universal Credit
Support for Mortgage Interest
Alongside this, other personal circumstances are also considered on whether you are eligible for the money, such as whether you have young children living with you, or if you have a disability.

If you’re eligible, then the payment should be made automatically.

The Cold Weather payment is not available to those living in Scotland as those eligible instead receive an annual £50 Winter Heating Payment.

You can check if your area is eligible to get a payment here.

Winter Fuel Payment
The Winter Fuel Payment is available to help eligible people with their heating bills and they could receive betwee £250 and £600.

If you were born on or before September, 25, 1956 you will be eligible for the scheme.

You’ll usually get this automatically if you are eligible and get State Pension or another social security benefit (not Housing Benefit, Child Benefit or Universal Credit). If you’re eligible but don’t get paid automatically, you will need to make a claim.

If you’ve got a Winter Fuel Payment before, you do not need to claim again unless you’ve deferred your State Pension or moved abroad.

The deadline for you to make a claim for winter 2022 to 2023 is 31 March 2023.

Energy Price Guarantee
The Energy Price Guarantee has been providing support for households amid rising energy costs and was due to end on March 31.

However, the UK Government has said that the scheme will now continue to provide support beyond April and it is understood that it could be extended for another year.
