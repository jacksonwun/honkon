UK weather: Storm Larisa batters UK with snow stalling M62 traffic
Met Office issues three amber warnings with ‘significant disruption’ to transport and power expected


Storm Larisa is battering parts of the UK, with gales and blizzards causing significant disruption including trapping motorists for hours overnight on a motorway in the north of England.

The Met Office has issued amber warnings for northern England, the Midlands, north Wales and Northern Ireland, where “significant disruption” to transport and power supplies is expected.

Yellow warnings for snow cover much of the rest of the UK, with the exception of south-east England and western Scotland.

The Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said the storm, which has been named by the French weather service, was bringing rain and snow to the UK.

“Storm Larisa is the same low pressure system that is bringing us the bands of rain,” he said. “But essentially, we’re on the northern side of the low pressure system, and it’s the southern side of that low pressure system that is going to be bringing particularly strong winds to parts of France.

“So that did originate out in the Atlantic and then it tracked its way eastward towards us, and the weather fronts that are swirling around that low pressure system have then been pushing into the cold air that has been in places across the UK and allowing that rain to start falling as snow across several areas.”

The worst of the weather is expected in north-west Wales and northern England, where gusts of “easily 50mph” are on a collision course with 30-40cm of snow.
