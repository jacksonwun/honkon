The incident took place at Rushey Green, Lewisham, where the victim was attacked from behind and hit repeatedly before the assailant stole his bag and fled the scene on a bus route 185 towards Victoria. The victim, in his 20s, was rushed to the hospital where a CT scan showed that he had suffered a bleed on the brain and his injuries at the time were classified as life-threatening. Thankfully the victim has since been discharged from the hospital after surviving the brutal attack. \n\nPolice are investigating the violent robbery and have released an image of the culprit who is wanted for questioning. The image shows a man who police believe could provide them with vital information that will help them solve the crime. Detective Sergeant Laura Warden, from the South East area's Robbery Squad, said, "This was an extremely violent robbery, which left the victim fighting for his life. We are determined to bring the person responsible for this heinous crime to justice. We have now released an image of a man we would like to speak to in connection with the robbery. It is a very clear image, so if that is you 
in the picture or if you know who it is, then please contact us as soon as possible." \n\nAnyone with any information that could assist in the investigation is urged to contact the police or call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
